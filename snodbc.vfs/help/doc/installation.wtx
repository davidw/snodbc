Installation
To install the extension, copy snodbc.kit to whatever place you want. To uninstall the extension, delete snodbc.kit from that place.

Well, if this package doesn't contains precompiled extensions for your platform, the process may be a little more complicated. Please see the ((portability)) page for more details.
