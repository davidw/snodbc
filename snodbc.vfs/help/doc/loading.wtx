Loading the Package
You need a TCL interpreter supporting starkits to make SnODBC available to your application.

Then you may load the package with two commands:
  **source snodbc.kit**
  **package require snodbc**

The package creates the **database** command in the global namespace, to be compatible with ((TclODBC)). If you don't want the command to be in the global namespace, just delete it and use its original name, **::odbc::database**.
